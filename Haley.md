I, Haley, feel really sorry to all...



Thanks to all to give me my own time to take course.

Be honest to try my best from tomorrow. 



I cannot figure out the things I cannot do through R crawling. 

Especially, I made code to crawl `img` tag, but because of things that does not have `img` tag, R has been occurring errors and let the Selinum stopped. I many times started to use TryCatch, if , for, try. But it does not work.



My conclusion today is that i will stop to find Elements of that at the moment, and focus on other activity!
